## UX (User Experience) 
### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to help users find meaningful gifts for people they care about or "Finding gifts they care about for the people you care about. 
The project is aimed toward people who either struggle to know what to get someone for a present or people who find that too often they get unwanted gifts which are then regifted or not enjoyed. 
The website needs to be visually appealing and simple enough to allow and encourage use for all ages and technological abilities.

#### User Goals:
* A website that serves as an online wishlist to be able to share with their friends and family.
* Simple and consistent theme and styles throughout to encourage engagement and provide a good user experience across generations.
* A website that allows one to quickly and easily locate gifts that someone actually wants.
* Ensure no duplication of gifts purchased.
* Easily share a wishlist. 
* Do everything possible to ensure that a gift will be purchased before being removed from a wishlist.
* Interact across all devices of all sizes.

## Design Choices: 

The theme of this project is gift giving, as a result the design is themed around being upbeat and positive. Using the resources in <a href='https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/colors-proven-to-boost-sales/'>this</a> blog I was able to pick out a colour scheme that has been proven to boost sales/interaction with a web page.

One key issue throughout this project is the fact that this website will often be used to bridge a generational gap. At times of gift giving it would be usual for people to buy gifts for someone in a different generation and it would often be more difficult to do so compared to someone in one's own generation. 

As a result of this the project had to be developed with simplicity to the forefront and had to be equally so across all devices as there is a marked difference in device use based on age ranges. <a href="https://www.klarna.com/knowledge/articles/should-you-think-mobile-first-or-mobile-only/">This</a> research shows the differing device use across ages and so it is very possible that a list will be written on one device and read on another.

##### Fonts: 
I chose the font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> as it a very simple style which is easily readable and not in any way distracting. The content is there to facilitate the creation of lists and assist in getting the right gift at the right time and not to provide a distraction.

##### Colours:
Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions: Using <a href='[Generate - Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/d9f0ff-5bc0eb-e55934-fa7921-fde74c)'>This</a> i was able to find a colour scheme that suited the afor mentioned points.
