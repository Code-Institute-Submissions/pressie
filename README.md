## UX (User Experience) 
### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to help users find meaningful gifts for people they care about or "Finding gifts they care about for the people you care about. 
The project is aimed toward people who either struggle to know what to get someone for a present or people who find that too often they get unwanted gifts which are then regifted or not enjoyed. 
The website needs to be visually appealing and simple enough to allow and encourage use for all ages and technological abilities.

#### User Goals:
* A website that serves as an online wishlist to be able to share with their friends and family.
* Simple and consistent theme and styles throughout to encourage engagement and provide a good user experience.
* A website that allows one to quickly and easily locate gifts that someone actually wants.
* Ensure no duplication of gifts purchased.
* Easily share a wishlist. 
* Do everything possible to ensure that a gift will be purchased before being removed from a wishlist.
* Interact across all devices of all sizes.

#### User Stories:

#### Site Owner Goals:
* Provide a great service for people looking for gifts.
* Collect data on what gifts are popular to assist future projects.
* Potentially offer a premium service which would allow for greater specification, ranking gifts in order etc. etc.

## User Requirements and Expectations:
##### Requirements:
* Create an online wishlist of meaningful gifts.
* Navigate the website using the navigation elements.
* Be able to easily access the wishlist of someone.
* Content displayed in a simple and consistent manner throughout.

## Design Choices: 

The theme of this project is gift giving, as a result the design is themed around being upbeat, positive and happy. Using the resources in <a href='https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/colors-proven-to-boost-sales/'>this</a> blog I was able to pick out a colour scheme that has been proven to boost sales/interaction with a web page.

##### Fonts: 
I chose the font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> as it a very simple style which is easily readable and not in any way distracting. The content is there to facilitate the creation of lists and assist in getting the right gift at the right time and not to provide a distraction.

##### Colours:
Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions: Using <a href='[Generate - Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/d9f0ff-5bc0eb-e55934-fa7921-fde74c)'>This</a> i was able to find a colour scheme that suited the afor mentioned points.

## Wireframes: 
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq mockups</a> + <a href="https://moqups.com/">Moqups</a>. First I started by doing a very basic wireframe for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop on Balsamiq - these were to get a basic understanding of how structurally elements would appear on the page. Next I moved onto Moqups to produce a more fleshed out wireframe for each device size, this time using a bit more colour and style. You can view this wireframe <a href="https://app.moqups.com/w7v4igcNUn/view/page/aa9df7b72">here</a>.

## Closing Notes:

Developing this project has taught me alot about how to provide users with appropriate data based on their interaction, working with new concepts like <strong>JSON objects</strong> has pushed my knowledge further and has helped me better understand how to manipulate this type of code. In the future I would like to implement other features like the ability to add certain packages to a wishlist to then review, compare and send to the company for further enquiry. As mentioned in the testing section this was the first time using the <strong>Google Maps API</strong> and therefore was a challenge to get to grips, however thanks to the helpful documentation I was able to achieve a solution in-line with the user requirements and also my plan made in testing.
